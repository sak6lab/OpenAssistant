# OpenAssistant

Our idea is an virutal assistant open source program which could replace products like Alexa or Google Home in the household. While all software would be free to use and monetize based off of the MIT License the hardware would be completely proprietary. The company would make money by hosting software (software as a service) but would mainly be focused on selling the hardware that actually make up the device.

The reasoning for choosing the MIT License was twofold. One, other companies within similar markets (open source software with paid hardware) such as Adafruit use this license and Two, as the business is mostly focused on selling hardware there is little reason to restrict other companies selling software based on our code.
