# OpenAssistant
## Description
We will sell Alexa-like devices which act as a virtual assistant to customers. Unlike devices such as Alexa or Google Home, OpenAssistant's source code would be open to the public.
While all software would be free to use and monetize based off of the MIT License the hardware would be completely proprietary.
This would allow for the public to refactor and modify the code in any way they like to craft their own, personalized assistant, any way they would like.

## Why MIT?
MIT allows for developers to do with their assistant whatever they would like. Where this business's revenue originates from the devices themselves and not the software, this is acceptable and even desireable.
With developers able to work freely with the code, it will promote a wide variety of virtual assistant features that will tailor to a large customer base.
